# House-Price-Prediction
In the house price prediction project utilizing machine learning, various algorithms were compared to determine the most accurate model. The algorithms evaluated included K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and AdaBoost Regressor. Each model was trained on a dataset comprising attributes such as latitude, longitude, house median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity. The performance of each algorithm was measured and compared based on their accuracy in predicting house prices, providing insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in the context of real estate valuation.
